1) "npm link" isn't working
   (besit uje)

2) "gendiff -h" isn't working. Instead of him: "bin/gendiff.js -h"
   (I checked evrth, but still IT DOES NOT WORK!! @#$%^)

3) If we determine requiring version of the node.js by adding this string in package.json:
      "node": "18.4.0"
   we will anyway fail the hexlet-check and one of the problems will be:
      npm ERR! Node.js v18.4.0

4) MB NOT PROBLEM:
   I love functions so much that I use them wherever others use constants, cause FUNCTIONS ARE FUNCTIONS!
